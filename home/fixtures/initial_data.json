The Classes and administration block have been constructed in a U shape and one of them is used as an administration block. There are 25 Physical Classes which are not enough but the school is working towards putting up more classes. &nbsp;We also expect to get sponsors and CDF office to help us build more classes. &nbsp;<br>There are 7 Dormitories built beyond the classes with a new one is to be put up. There are 3 staff houses and a modern kitchen. The school does not have a modern administration Block, Dining Hall, A Book Store And Home Science Complex.&nbsp;<br>KCSE performance in the 8-4-4- system started with a mean score of 3.14 in 1994 and currently at 4.186.
